# Agno Agent

Agno Agent is a modular and extensible framework for building AI-powered agents that can perform tasks such as web searches, financial data analysis, and more. It leverages OpenAI and Groq models, along with various tools, to provide intelligent and interactive responses.

## Features

- **Web Search Agents**: Use DuckDuckGo or Google Search tools to fetch information from the web.
- **Financial Data Analysis**: Retrieve and analyze financial data using YFinance tools.
- **Agent Teaming**: Combine multiple agents to work collaboratively on complex tasks.
- **SQLite Storage**: Store agent sessions and history in a SQLite database.
- **Markdown Support**: Generate responses with markdown formatting for better readability.

## Requirements

The project requires the following dependencies, which are listed in `requirements.txt`:

- `phidata`: For data engineering and workflow automation.
- `python-dotenv`: For managing environment variables.
- `yfinance`: For fetching financial data from Yahoo Finance.
- `packaging`: For version parsing and comparison.
- `duckduckgo-search`: For performing DuckDuckGo search queries.
- `fastapi`: For building the API.
- `uvicorn`: For running the FastAPI application.
- `groq`: For interacting with Groq-based models.
- `openai`: For interacting with OpenAI's API.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Agno-FinanceAgent
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
     GROQ_API_KEY=<your_groq_api_key>
     ```

## Usage

### Running the Playground

The playground allows you to interact with the agents via a web interface.

1. Start the playground app:
   ```bash
   python playground.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to the provided URL to interact with the agents.

### Running Simple Agents

You can also run individual agents directly using `simpleagents.py`.

1. Execute the script:
   ```bash
   python simpleagents.py
   ```

2. The script will print responses generated by the agents.

## Agents Overview

### Web Agents

- **OpenAI Web Agent (DuckDuckGo)**: Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model and DuckDuckGo tools for web searches.
- **Groq Web Agent (DuckDuckGo)**: Uses Groq's Qwen model and DuckDuckGo tools for web searches.
- **Groq Web Agent (Google)**: Uses Groq's Qwen model and Google Search tools for web searches.

### Finance Agent

- **OpenAI Finance Agent**: Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model and YFinance tools to retrieve and analyze financial data.

### Agent Team

- Combines the Web and Finance agents to collaboratively handle complex tasks.

## File Structure

- `playground.py`: Defines and serves the playground app with multiple agents.
- `simpleagents.py`: Demonstrates the usage of individual agents and agent teams.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required for the project.
- `.env`: Stores environment variables (not included in the repository).
